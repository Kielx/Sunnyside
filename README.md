# Sunnyside agency landing page

A nice-looking landing page for a creative agency created with React and Tailwind CSS.
Thanks to Tailwind I managed to code this from 0 to working in little more than 24 hours.

## Overview

The project was a challenge from [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).
I decided that my portfolio of projects is lacking something good-looking and well designed so coding that landing page would be a good experience and asset. 

### The challenge

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS. Utility and Mobile First CSS was a challenge itself. Nevertheless, the experience was really good and allowed me to create this project in a little more than 24 hours.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com//) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This was a rapid project so I could showcase something with cool colors and good design. It was also a good chance to practice Tailwind CSS and writing all styles from scratch. Overall it was a great learning opportunity. Definitely going to stay with Tailwind for longer.
